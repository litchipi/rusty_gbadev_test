# Rusty GBA dev test

Just a test project displaying and testing the capabilities of the [Rusty GBA library](https://github.com/litchipi/rusty_gbadev).

Provides the code, but also the build system to create a **.gba** file from scratch, using indications
of the awesome [gba crate](https://crates.io/crates/gba).

Can be used as a template to simply start a new project with Rusty GBA.
